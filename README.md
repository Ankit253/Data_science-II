# Probability Statistics and Random Processes.
Repository contains lab projects from the IC252 course at IIT Mandi.  <br />

LAB-2 : worked on Coditional probbility <br />
LAB-3 : Bayes' Rule 
<br />
LAB-4 : Independence and Conditional Probability using different plots <br />
<br />

LAb-5 : Studied Model for channel (e.g., ***mobile communication via a wireless channel***) and understand marginal, conditional and joint distributions and their
interrelation.<br />
<br />
LAB-6 : ***Analysed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data*** from various data sources including data from India and around the world. <br />
Worked on the Patient-level case data from China and analysed incubation period of diiferent residents( including and excluding Wuhan). <br />
Also worked on the ***time series covid-19 data*** of cumulative *region-wise* cases---Confirmed, Recovered and Deaths  <br />

LAB-7 : Sample Covariance and Sample Correlation of data.
<br />
LAB-8 : Used exponential distribution to model time to the ***arrival of the next confirmed case of Covid-19 in India*** 
<br />
LAB-9 : verification of “weak law of large numbers (WLLN)” and the “central limit theorem (CLT)” numerically. 
<br />

LAB-10 : Monte Carlo Simulation.
